Upload-Amazon-S3
================
This is an tryout to upload files to Amazon Web Services (AWS), S3, through a web page, implemented on ```NodeJS```.

## Build The App
    cd Upload-Amazon-S3
    npm install
    node app.js

The programme will listen to port 3000 by default, thus you can go to ```http://localhost:3000/``` to try :p

## What you have to take care
You should replace your S3 bucket and your AWS access key in the file, ```routes/s3.js```
